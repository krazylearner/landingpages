You are responsible for regularly reviewing the avgtech.tk website to be notified of any amendments to the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p><b>ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b></p>
<p><b>Arbitration</b></p>
<p>Any claim, dispute, or controversy (“Claim”) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the relationships among the parties hereto shall be resolved by one arbitrator through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), under the AAA Consumer Rules in effect at the time the Claim is filed (“AAA Rules”). The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable.  Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made for judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration proceedings shall be held in New York, U.S.A. and shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, the intentions of the parties as stated herein, international commercial practice, and the governing law of this Agreement. Â No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p>
<p><b>Class Action Waiver</b></p>
<p>The Parties hereby expressly agreed that any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. The arbitrator shall not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, THEY UNDERSTAND AND CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY, THROUGH ARBITRATION. THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>Before you take a dispute to arbitration or to small claims court, you must first contact us by writing us and describing (a) the nature and basis of the Claim or dispute; and (b) the specific relief sought (“Demand”) and give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. Similarly, before avgtech.tk takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it by contacting you. If you and avgtech.tk do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days from the date you or avgtech.tk is notified by the other of a dispute, you or avgtech.tk may commence an arbitration proceeding. If your Claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by telephone, or by an in-person hearing as established by the rules of the arbitration administrator.</p>
<p>Information about the arbitration process and the AAA’s Arbitration Rules and its fees are available from the AAA on the Internet at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. By notifying avgtech.tk within twenty days after commencing an arbitration proceeding, you may elect to relieve both parties to the arbitration of confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p>The amount of any settlement offer made by avgtech.tk shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you are entitled.  After avgtech.tk receives notice that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee required by the arbitration administrator, unless your Claim is for greater than $75,000.</p>
<p>If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your Claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of avgtech.tk’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then avgtech.tk will pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 (“the alternative payment”), whichever is greater.</p>
<p>If avgtech.tk prevails before the arbitrator, and if we show that you acted in bad faith in bringing your claim, then avgtech.tk may seek to recover the AAA’s fees and expenses of the arbitrator from you.</p>
